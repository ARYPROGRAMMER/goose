# System Alerts - Inline Display Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Created SystemAlertMessage Component
- New component at `ui/desktop/src/components/SystemAlertMessage.tsx`
- Displays system alerts with appropriate styling based on level (info, warning, error, success)
- Shows timestamp for each alert
- Uses icons to indicate alert type

### 2. Modified ProgressiveMessageList
- Added `systemAlerts` prop to receive alerts from parent
- Tracks displayed alerts to avoid duplicates
- Inserts alerts chronologically between messages based on timestamps
- Alerts appear before messages if they occurred earlier
- Automatically triggers scroll when new alerts are added

### 3. Updated BaseChat Component
- Removed floating corner alerts display
- Passes `systemAlerts` to ProgressiveMessageList for inline rendering
- Alerts now appear in the conversation flow

### 4. Added CSS Animation
- Added `animate-fade-in` class for smooth alert appearance
- Defined `fade-in` keyframe animation in main.css

## Visual Changes

### Before:
- System alerts appeared as floating notifications in the top-right corner
- Overlaid on top of the conversation
- Could obscure content
- Disappeared after a timeout

### After:
- System alerts appear inline within the conversation
- Chronologically positioned between messages
- Permanent part of the conversation history
- Styled with appropriate colors and icons based on alert level
- Smooth fade-in animation when appearing

## Benefits

1. **Better Context**: Alerts appear exactly where they occurred in the conversation timeline
2. **No Obstruction**: Alerts don't cover any part of the interface
3. **Persistent History**: Alerts remain visible as part of the conversation history
4. **Automatic Scrolling**: View automatically scrolls to show new alerts
5. **Cleaner UI**: No floating elements overlapping the conversation

## Testing

To test the new inline alerts:
1. Trigger system alerts during a conversation
2. Observe that alerts appear inline between messages
3. Verify automatic scrolling when alerts appear
4. Check that alert styling matches the level (error=red, warning=yellow, success=green, info=blue)
5. Confirm timestamps are displayed correctly
