Alright, so the user is asking me to list the files in the current directory. Let's see what I can do here.

First, I remember that as an AI agent with access to various tools, including the developer extension, which allows me to run shell commands on macOS. The current directory is /Users/micn/Documents/code/goose.

I need to figure out the right shell command to list files. On macOS, using 'ls' usually does the trick. But sometimes it's better to get detailed information, so maybe I should use 'ls -la' which shows all files, including hidden ones, with details like permissions and sizes.

Wait, but the user just wants a simple listing. Maybe starting with 'ls' is enough. If that doesn't show everything, I can suggest the more verbose command as well.

I should also consider whether there are any subdirectories or specific files they might be interested in. The project hints mention it's a Rust project with crates and an Electron app in typescript under ui/desktop. So perhaps mentioning those directories would be helpful.

I think the best approach is to execute the 'ls' command using the developer__shell tool and then present the output clearly, maybe even offer more details if needed. That way, the user gets a straightforward answer with options for further information.

To list files in the current directory `/Users/micn/Documents/code/goose`, I will use the `ls` command.

```bash
<developer__shell>
  <command>ls</command>
</developer__shell>

This will return the list of files and directories in the current directory. If you'd like to see additional details, such as hidden files and detailed information about each file, you can use `ls -la`.

Would you like me to run that command for you?
