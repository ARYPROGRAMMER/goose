Alright, so I need to figure out how to list the files in the current directory. The user mentioned they're using a tool that provides various functions, including one called developer__list_files which returns a JSON array of file details. 

First, I should recall if there are any commands or tools typically used for listing files in a directory. In Unix-based systems, the 'ls' command is commonly used. But since this seems to be within a specific tool's context, I might need to use that tool's functions instead of regular shell commands.

Looking at the available functions provided earlier, there's a function named developer__list_files that doesn't require any parameters and returns information about files in JSON format. So, perhaps using this function is the right approach here.

I should structure my thought process by considering each step logically. First, determine the correct function to use. Then, understand how to invoke it without any arguments as required. After invoking the function, I'll receive a JSON response containing file names and other details like modification dates and sizes.

Wait, but in this case, when the user just asked "list files in this directory," they might not need all that extra information. Maybe they just want a simple list of filenames. However, since the provided function gives more detailed info, perhaps I should proceed with using it to get comprehensive results.

So, my plan is to use the developer__list_files function without any parameters and present the JSON output as the answer.

To list the files in the current directory, you can use the `developer__list_files` function. Here's how to do it:

1. **Identify the Function**: The appropriate function for listing files is `developer__list_files`.
2. **Invocation**: Call this function without any parameters.

**Command:**
```json
{
  "function": "developer__list_files"
}
```

This will return a JSON array containing details about each file in the directory, including their names and other relevant information.
