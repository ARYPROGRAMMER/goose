Okay, so the user wants to list all the files in their current directory. They mentioned that they're using a macOS system and the project is located at /Users/micn/Documents/code/goose. I remember from the initial conversation that the developer extension is enabled, which means I can use its tools.

Looking at the available tools, there's a text_editor tool with commands like view, write, str_replace, etc., but those might not be necessary here. Then there are image_processor and screen_capture tools, but again, probably not needed for listing files. The developer shell tool is also available, which can run shell commands.

So the most straightforward way is to use the shell tool's echo command to list all files in the directory. I should suggest a command like `echo -al "file: /Users/micn/Documents/code/goose/*.txt"`. This will display each file name followed by "file:" on separate lines, making it easy to see them all at once.

I also need to make sure that the command is correctly formatted within the <developer__shell> tag. No additional parameters are needed since just listing the directory should suffice. The user can run this command and then copy the output or use another tool if they want a more detailed view, like ls for a standard listing.

To list all files in the specified directory, you can use a shell command through the developer extension's shell tool.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Open Terminal on your macOS system.
2. Run the following command to list all text files:
   ```bash
   echo -al "file: /Users/micn/Documents/code/goose/*.txt"
   ```

This will display each file name followed by "file:" in the terminal, making it easy for you to see what's inside your Goose project.

If you need a more detailed listing or have specific file types in mind, feel free to let me know!
