## 2025-09-05 Update - IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED ✅

### Completed Work
- AgentManager core implementation in crates/goose/src/agents/manager.rs
- goose-server state.rs migrated from shared agent to AgentManager
- Routes updated (reply.rs, extension.rs, agent.rs, context.rs)
- Basic unit tests for AgentManager (session isolation, cleanup, metrics)
- Session-based agent retrieval implemented
- Added monitoring API endpoints (/agent/stats, /agent/cleanup)
- Fixed backward compatibility for /reply endpoint (auto-generates session_id)
- Successfully tested and verified AgentManager functionality

### Testing Results ✅
- **Session Isolation**: VERIFIED - Each session gets unique agent
- **Session Reuse**: VERIFIED - Same session_id reuses same agent (cache hits)
- **Metrics Tracking**: VERIFIED - Accurate tracking of agents_created, cache_hits/misses
- **Monitoring Endpoints**: WORKING - /agent/stats and /agent/cleanup functional
- **Backward Compatibility**: WORKING - /reply auto-generates session_id if not provided

### Critical Configuration Discoveries
- **Secret Key Environment Variable**: `GOOSE_SERVER__SECRET_KEY` (double underscore!)
- **Secret Key Header**: `X-Secret-Key` (case-sensitive)
- **No /api prefix**: Routes directly under root (e.g., /reply, /agent/stats)
- **Must use screen**: Background processes don't work properly without screen

### Research Findings
- Extension isolation: AUTOMATIC - Each Agent has own ExtensionManager
- Provider isolation: AUTOMATIC - Each Agent has own provider config
- No additional work needed for isolation - inherent in design

### Implementation Progress
- Phase 1: AgentManager Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- Phase 2: goose-server Integration ✅ COMPLETE & VERIFIED
- Phase 3: Tool Approval Bubbling ⏳ PLANNED
- Phase 4: Scheduler Migration ⏳ TODO
- Phase 5: SubAgent Removal ⏳ TODO

### Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3: Tool Approval Bubbling implementation
2. Performance benchmarking (targets: <10ms creation, <20MB per agent)
3. Migrate scheduler to use AgentManager
4. Remove SubAgent implementation

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Architecture successfully migrated from shared agent to per-session agents
- ✅ Complete session isolation achieved
- ✅ Extension and provider isolation automatic
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Multi-user support enabled
- ✅ Concurrency issues resolved
