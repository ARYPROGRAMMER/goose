# Terminal-Bench Analysis

## Overview
Terminal-Bench evaluates AI agents' proficiency in executing complex tasks within terminal environments. ~100 tasks across various domains.

## Task Domains
- System administration
- Security
- Data science
- Machine learning
- Software development
- Network configuration
- File operations

## Task Structure
Each task includes:
1. **Instruction**: Clear task description
2. **Test Script**: Automated verification
3. **Reference Solution**: Oracle implementation
4. **Docker Environment**: Consistent, isolated testing

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary Metric**: Task Completion Rate
- Formula: (Completed Tasks / Total Tasks) Ã— 100%
- Binary success/failure per task

## Scoring Process
1. Docker container initialization
2. Agent receives task instruction
3. Agent interacts with terminal
4. Commands executed
5. Test script verifies completion
6. Result logged

## Key Success Factors for Agents

### 1. File Management
- Efficient multi-file editing
- Understanding file dependencies
- Atomic operations across files

### 2. Code Search & Navigation
- Finding relevant code quickly
- Understanding project structure
- Following dependencies

### 3. Command Execution
- Proper shell command sequencing
- Error handling and recovery
- State management between commands

### 4. Context Management
- Maintaining relevant context
- Efficient token usage
- Understanding task requirements
