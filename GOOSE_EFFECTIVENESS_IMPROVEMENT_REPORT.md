## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Approach: Enhance Developer MCP Extension

The most effective approach is to enhance the existing developer MCP extension rather than creating new platform tools or bundled CLIs. This provides:
- Minimal disruption to existing architecture
- Immediate availability across all Goose interfaces
- Easy testing and deployment
- Backward compatibility

### Phase 1: Core Enhancements (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Unified Diff Support
Add unified diff format to the text_editor tool:

```rust
// New command option for text_editor
command: "udiff"  // Apply unified diff patch
udiff_content: String  // The unified diff to apply
```

**Benefits:**
- 90% token reduction for large edits
- Standard Git-compatible format
- Precise multi-line changes

#### 1.2 Multi-File Edit Transaction
New tool for atomic multi-file operations:

```rust
#[tool(
    name = "multi_file_edit",
    description = "Apply multiple file edits atomically"
)]
pub struct MultiFileEditParams {
    edits: Vec<FileEdit>,
    atomic: bool,  // All-or-nothing application
}

pub struct FileEdit {
    path: String,
    operation: EditOperation,
}

pub enum EditOperation {
    Write { content: String },
    Replace { old_str: String, new_str: String },
    UDiff { diff: String },
    Insert { line: i64, content: String },
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Atomic operations across multiple files
- Dependency-aware ordering
- Rollback on failure

#### 1.3 Repository Map
New tool for understanding code structure:

```rust
#[tool(
    name = "repo_map",
    description = "Generate a map of file dependencies and structure"
)]
pub struct RepoMapParams {
    max_depth: Option<u32>,
    include_imports: bool,
    include_exports: bool,
    file_pattern: Option<String>,
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Use ripgrep to find imports/exports
- Build dependency graph
- Cache results for performance

### Phase 2: Search Enhancement (Week 3)

#### 2.1 Semantic Code Search
New tool for intelligent code search:

```rust
#[tool(
    name = "code_search",
    description = "Search code semantically with context"
)]
pub struct CodeSearchParams {
    query: String,
    search_type: SearchType,
    max_results: Option<u32>,
    context_lines: Option<u32>,
}

pub enum SearchType {
    Literal,      // Exact text match
    Regex,        // Regular expression
    Semantic,     // Meaning-based search
    Symbol,       // Function/class names
    Reference,    // Find usages
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Start with ripgrep for literal/regex
- Add tree-sitter integration for AST parsing
- Rank results by relevance

#### 2.2 Context Manager
Enhanced context retrieval:

```rust
#[tool(
    name = "get_context",
    description = "Retrieve relevant code context for a task"
)]
pub struct GetContextParams {
    task_description: String,
    max_tokens: Option<u32>,
    include_tests: bool,
    include_docs: bool,
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4+)

#### 3.1 Edit Planning
Separate planning from execution:

```rust
#[tool(
    name = "plan_edits",
    description = "Generate an edit plan before execution"
)]
pub struct PlanEditsParams {
    task: String,
    files: Vec<String>,
    dry_run: bool,
}
```

#### 3.2 Git Integration
Enhanced Git operations:

```rust
#[tool(
    name = "git_ops",
    description = "Git operations with context"
)]
pub struct GitOpsParams {
    operation: GitOperation,
    message: Option<String>,
    files: Option<Vec<String>>,
}

pub enum GitOperation {
    Status,
    Diff,
    Commit,
    Stash,
    Reset,
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Minimal Viable Implementation

For immediate impact, implement these three features:

#### 1. Unified Diff in text_editor.rs
```rust
pub async fn text_editor_udiff(
    path: &PathBuf,
    diff: &str,
    file_history: &Arc<Mutex<HashMap<PathBuf, Vec<String>>>>,
) -> Result<Vec<Content>, ErrorData> {
    // Save current content for undo
    save_file_history(path, file_history)?;
    
    // Apply diff using patch command or diff-patch crate
    let current = std::fs::read_to_string(path)?;
    let patched = apply_unified_diff(&current, diff)?;
    
    // Write result
    std::fs::write(path, patched)?;
    
    Ok(vec![Content::text("Successfully applied diff")])
}
```

#### 2. Repository Map using ripgrep
```rust
pub async fn repo_map(&self) -> Result<CallToolResult, ErrorData> {
    // Find all source files
    let files_output = self.execute_shell_command(
        "rg --files --type-add 'code:*.{rs,py,js,ts,go,java}' -t code",
        &peer
    ).await?;
    
    // Find imports for each file
    let mut dependency_map = HashMap::new();
    for file in files_output.lines() {
        let imports = self.execute_shell_command(
            &format!("rg '^(import|use|require|from .* import)' {}", file),
            &peer
        ).await?;
        dependency_map.insert(file, parse_imports(&imports));
    }
    
    // Format as tree structure
    let map = format_dependency_tree(&dependency_map);
    Ok(CallToolResult::success(vec![Content::text(map)]))
}
```

#### 3. Code Search with context
```rust
pub async fn code_search(
    &self,
    params: Parameters<CodeSearchParams>,
) -> Result<CallToolResult, ErrorData> {
    let query = &params.0.query;
    let context = params.0.context_lines.unwrap_or(3);
    
    // Use ripgrep with context
    let search_cmd = format!(
        "rg '{}' -A {} -B {} --json",
        query, context, context
    );
    
    let results = self.execute_shell_command(&search_cmd, &peer).await?;
    
    // Parse and rank results
    let ranked = parse_and_rank_results(&results, query);
    
    Ok(CallToolResult::success(vec![Content::text(ranked)]))
}
```
