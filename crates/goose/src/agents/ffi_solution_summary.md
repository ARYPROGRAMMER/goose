# FFI-Friendly Agent Solution Summary

## Problem

The original `reply` method in the Goose agent returns a `BoxStream` that yields messages asynchronously. This design is problematic for FFI because:

1. Async streams don't translate well across FFI boundaries
2. Kotlin/JVM doesn't have native support for Rust's async streams
3. The yielding behavior makes it difficult to maintain state across language boundaries

## Solution

We created an FFI-friendly agent design that replaces the async stream with a state machine pattern:

### Key Components

1. **FFIAgent**: A wrapper around the original Agent that provides FFI-friendly methods
2. **ReplyState**: A stateful object that manages the conversation flow
3. **ReplyProcessState**: An enum that tracks the current state of the conversation
4. **PendingToolRequest**: A structure to handle tool approval requests

### Design Principles

1. **State Machine**: Instead of yielding messages, we use a state machine that advances through different states
2. **Synchronous Interface**: All FFI methods are synchronous, using `block_on` internally
3. **Explicit State Management**: The caller can check the current state and act accordingly
4. **Tool Approval Flow**: Tool requests are handled explicitly with approve/deny methods

### Implementation

The implementation consists of:

1. `ffi_agent.rs`: Contains the FFI-friendly agent implementation
2. Comprehensive tests to verify the functionality
3. Documentation for how to use the new design
4. Guide for updating FFI bindings

### Benefits

1. **FFI Compatible**: Works well across language boundaries
2. **Clear Control Flow**: The state machine makes the flow explicit
3. **Error Handling**: Errors are captured in the state machine
4. **Memory Safe**: Proper memory management with Arc and clear ownership
5. **Testable**: Easy to test each state transition

### Usage Pattern

```kotlin
val replyState = agent.createReplyState(messages, sessionConfig)
replyState.start()

while (replyState.getState() != ReplyProcessState.COMPLETED) {
    when (replyState.getState()) {
        ReplyProcessState.MESSAGE_YIELDED -> {
            // Process message
            replyState.advance()
        }
        ReplyProcessState.WAITING_FOR_TOOL_APPROVAL -> {
            // Handle tool approvals
        }
        // ... handle other states
    }
}
```

This solution provides a scalable design that can be easily extended and maintained while working well across FFI boundaries.
