Based on our conversation so far, could you create:

1. A concise set of instructions (1-2 paragraphs) that describe what you've been helping with. Pay special attention if any output styles or formats are requested (and make it clear), and note any non standard tools used or required.

2. A list of 3-5 example activities (as a few words each at most) that would be relevant to this topic

Format your response with clear headings for 'Instructions:' and 'Activities:' sections
For example, perhaps we have been discussing fruit and you might write:

Instructions:
Using web searches we find pictures of fruit, and always check what language to reply in.

Activities:
Show pics of apples, say a random fruit, share a fruit fact
