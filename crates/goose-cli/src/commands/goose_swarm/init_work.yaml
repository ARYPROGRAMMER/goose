  {{ context }}


  Based on what you can tell, you are to select from one of the following template repos to help get started:

  https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app - typescript template
  https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter - for apps which are mobile targeted, but can work as a progressive web apps
  https://github.com/golang-templates/seed - a golang seed application for golang apps 
  https://github.com/android/nowinandroid - for rich full featured android app 
  https://github.com/Q42/template-ios - for ios 

  For x-platform mobile apps, consider making a flutter app if not a PWA 



  Clone a template repo into ~/.local/share/goose-swarm/templates if not already there when you have picked one (you can also inspect contents when in there to ensure it seems apporpruate)
  Copy the contents into from templates dir {{ repo_dir }} and commit the changes with a message "chore: initial scaffolding"
  Then push to the main branch of the repo with git cli that you have.  

  use this pattern to sync it: 
  
     `rsync -a --exclude='.git/' ~/.local/share/goose-swarm/templates/<chosen-template>/ {{ repo_dir }}/`
     `git add . && git commit -m "chore: initial scaffolding" && git push origin main`
