RMCP Migration

We're migrating the internal MCP crates in this project to the official Rust SDK for MCP

Look at the full source code of the crates in crates/mcp-* and then read all the documentation and source code of https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk

Append to this file content for tracking phases of a migration between the two. I should be able to continuously feed this document to an AI coding agent to complete the migration

Make it so I have incremental milestones I can check in and put up as separate PRs
